# Setting up AWS Amplify

This guide will be exactly similar to [Amplify's Setup Guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/quickstart/#make-frontend-updates).

Even though the project already has Amplify installed within its packages, AWS requires 
for every developer to login into the AWS account. This guide will help you
in figuring out how to do that.
